**What to Say (Script):**
"Good morning. My name is Krystian. Thank you for your time today.

I'm a specialist in applied Artificial Intelligence with a background in Aerospace Engineering and cloud architecture. For years, my focus has been on helping large industrial companies solve a very specific problem: how to extract actionable, high-value insights from massive volumes of complex, unstructured data.

At GE Aerospace, I was part of a team leading the AI transformation, specifically on predictive maintenance projects. More recently at Mimira, I designed and built core algorithms to automate complex processes in the public tender field.

I'm here today because the challenges I've solved are directly applicable to the maritime industry, and specifically to the sophisticated operations you run here at Helix. My goal is to show you how we can leverage AI to transform your existing safety data from a reactive, archival record into a proactive tool for preventing future incidents."

### Slide 3: The Industrial AI Revolution - A Global Trend

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   AI is no longer a future concept; it's a core operational tool across major industries.
*   **Aviation:** Predictive maintenance reduces downtime and improves safety.
*   **Manufacturing:** AI-powered quality control and process optimization.
*   **Legal & Finance:** Automating discovery by analyzing millions of legacy documents (contracts, reports).
*   **The Common Thread:** Unlocking value from vast, previously unusable legacy data.
*   **The Question:** How can the maritime industry harness this same power?

**What to Say (Script):**
"Before we dive into the specifics for Helix, I want to briefly set the stage. The adoption of AI is not a niche trend; it's a fundamental shift happening across every major industrial sector.

In aviation, my former domain, airlines use AI to predict component failures before they happen. In advanced manufacturing, AI vision systems monitor production lines to catch microscopic defects. We're even seeing this revolution in the legal industry, where AI can analyze millions of pages of contracts for discovery in a fraction of the time it would take a human team.

The common theme in all these success stories is the strategic use of data, and specifically **legacy data**. Large companies everywhere have decades of valuable operational history trapped in old formats—scanned PDFs, Word documents, unstructured text files. This information was previously unusable at scale. AI provides the key to finally unlock this trapped value.

It allows companies to shift from reactive fixes to a proactive strategy built on a complete understanding of their own history. This brings us to the core opportunity for the maritime world and for Helix. The same principles can be applied to your operations today."

### Slide 4: The Opportunity - The Goldmine in Your Data

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   You already possess a strong safety framework (Incident Reports, PTW).
*   This creates a "goldmine" of data—a detailed history of every operational event.
*   **The Challenge:** This value is locked in unstructured text (PDFs, descriptions), hiding crucial patterns.
*   **The Opportunity:** To shift from a *reactive* model (learning after an incident) to a *proactive* one (preventing the next incident).

**What to Say (Script):**
"Helix already has a robust framework for safety, with established systems for incident reporting and Permits to Work. This is the foundation of a strong safety culture.

Within these systems, you are sitting on a goldmine of data. Every incident report, every near-miss observation, and every PTW contains incredibly valuable information. It's a detailed history of what has happened on your vessels, under specific conditions, involving specific equipment.

The challenge, however, is that this data is largely unstructured. It lives in PDFs and text descriptions. It's hard for a human, or even traditional software, to analyze hundreds or thousands of these reports and connect the dots between seemingly unrelated events.

This leads to a reactive approach. We learn the lesson *after* the incident. The opportunity is to flip that model—to use AI to find the hidden patterns in your existing data and prevent the next incident before it happens."

### Slide 5: The Solution - The AI-Powered Safety Advisor

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   Introducing the **Safety Advisor**: A web-based AI platform.
*   **1. Extracts & Structures:** Automatically reads your reports (any format) and converts them into structured, analyzable data.
*   **2. Identifies Hidden Risks:** AI engine analyzes all data to find trends, anomalies, and correlations invisible to the human eye.
*   **3. Powers Proactive PTW:** The game-changer. It automatically cross-references new work permits with your entire incident history to flag potential risks *before* work begins.

**What to Say (Script):**
"To seize this opportunity, I've developed the **Safety Advisor**: a web-based platform designed specifically for this task. It does three key things:

First, it automatically extracts and structures your data. The platform ingests your incident reports—in whatever format they exist—and uses AI to understand and categorize the information. It identifies the vessel, location, equipment involved, weather conditions, time of day, and, most importantly, it analyzes the human-written descriptions to understand the context and root cause.

Second, it provides intelligent trend analysis. This structured data feeds into a dynamic dashboard. But this is not just another charting tool. The AI actively searches for trends, anomalies, and correlations that would be invisible otherwise. It can flag, for example, that a specific piece of equipment on a certain vessel class has a higher rate of near-misses during specific weather conditions—an insight that allows for targeted, proactive maintenance or training.

Third, and most powerfully, it makes your Permit to Work system proactive. This is where the platform truly changes the game. When a crew submits a new PTW, the Safety Advisor instantly analyzes the planned job. It cross-references the task, location, and equipment against your entire historical incident database. If it finds a past incident that shares similarities with the work about to be performed, it immediately alerts the crew and supervisors. It provides them with the original report, showing them exactly what went wrong in the past, so they can prevent it from happening again."

### Slide 6: Live Demonstration

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   **1. The Central Dashboard:** A fleet-wide, real-time view of safety KPIs and AI-identified trends.
*   **2. Seamless Data Entry:** Upload a new PDF incident report -> Watch it get processed and integrated in seconds.
*   **3. Proactive PTW in Action:** Create a new work permit -> See the system instantly flag a historical risk.

**What to Say (Script):**
"Now, I'd like to show you exactly how this works. Please keep in mind that the data you're about to see is anonymized for this demonstration.

First, we're looking at the central dashboard. It gives you a fleet-wide overview of safety performance. You can see key metrics, filterable by vessel, incident type, or date. The AI has already identified a few emerging trends here...

Next, I'll upload a new incident report as a standard PDF. Watch how quickly the system processes it. Within seconds, the key information has been extracted, and our dashboard metrics are updated. The data is now part of our knowledge base.

Finally, the most critical feature. Let's create a new Permit to Work for a job involving... [pick a relevant example, e.g., 'crane maintenance on the aft deck']. The system instantly flags that a similar job, under similar conditions, was associated with an incident 18 months ago. It provides the team with a direct link to that report, giving them critical knowledge to perform their work more safely."

### Slide 7: What Makes This Different? The Core Values

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   **Goes Beyond Dashboards:** We don't just *display* data, we *create structured intelligence* from your unstructured text.
*   **Focus on Proactive Prevention:** Standard tools show you what happened yesterday. We use that data to help you prevent what could happen tomorrow.
*   **Designed for the User:**
    *   **Easy to Use:** Clean, intuitive interface requires no special training.
    *   **Explainable AI:** No 'black boxes'. The system shows you *why* it flagged a risk.
    *   **Self-Improving:** The more data it has, the smarter and more accurate it gets.

**What to Say (Script):**
"So, you might be asking, 'How is this different from a regular business intelligence tool?'

The key difference is that we are not just displaying data; we are creating structured, actionable intelligence from unstructured text. We unlock the value that is currently trapped in your documents.

This allows us to be proactive, not reactive. Traditional dashboards show you what happened yesterday. Our system uses that information to tell you what might happen tomorrow, and gives you the chance to intervene.

I've designed this platform with several core principles in mind: It must be easy to use, with a clean and intuitive interface that requires no special training. The AI is not a 'black box.' When it flags a risk, it shows you precisely which data points led to its conclusion, ensuring transparency and trust. And finally, the system is designed to learn. The more data it processes, the more accurate it becomes, continuously improving the safety intelligence across your fleet."

    *   Let us analyze a sample of *your* historical incident reports.
    *   We will provide a concrete demonstration of the value locked in your data.
    *   **No major commitment required.**

**What to Say (Script):**
"We know that bringing on a new system involves important considerations. Data security is paramount; your data is your asset, and the platform is built to the highest standards. We also believe the cost should be tied to the value delivered, so we can discuss flexible models. Most importantly, we are committed to a partnership, meaning we will work with you to rapidly evolve the product to meet your future needs.

The best way to see the power of this platform is to see it work with your own data. I'd like to propose a limited-scope pilot project.

We would take a sample of your historical incident reports and run them through the system. This would provide you with a concrete demonstration of the insights and value we can unlock from your data, with no major commitment required from your side. It's a low-risk, high-reward way to validate the potential of proactive, AI-driven safety for Helix."
