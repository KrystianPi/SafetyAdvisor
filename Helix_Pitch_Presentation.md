**What to Say (Script):**
"Good morning. My name is Krystian. Thank you for your time today.

I'm a specialist in applied Artificial Intelligence with a background in Aerospace Engineering and cloud architecture. For years, my focus has been on helping large industrial companies solve one very specific problem: how to extract actionable, high-value insights from massive volumes of complex, unstructured data.

At GE Aerospace, I was part of a team leading the AI transformation, specifically on predictive maintenance projects. More recently at Mimira, I designed and built core algorithms to automate complex processes in the public tender field.

I'm here today because the challenges I've solved are directly applicable to the maritime industry, and specifically to the sophisticated operations you run at Helix. My goal is to show you how we can transform your existing safety data from a reactive, archival record into your most powerful proactive asset for preventing future incidents."

### Slide 3: The Industrial AI Revolution - A Global Trend

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   AI is no longer a future concept; it's a core operational tool across major industries.
*   **Aviation:** Predictive maintenance reduces downtime and improves safety.
*   **Manufacturing:** AI-powered quality control and process optimization.
*   **Legal & Finance:** Automating discovery by analyzing millions of legacy documents (contracts, reports).
*   **The Common Thread:** Unlocking strategic value from vast, previously unusable legacy data.
*   **The Question:** How can the maritime industry harness this same power?

**What to Say (Script):**
"Before we dive into the specifics for Helix, I want to set the stage. The adoption of AI is not a niche trend; it's a fundamental shift happening across every major industrial sector.

In aviation, my former domain, airlines use AI to predict component failures before they happen. In advanced manufacturing, AI vision systems monitor production lines to catch microscopic defects. We're even seeing this revolution in the legal industry, where AI can analyze millions of pages of contracts in a fraction of the time it would take a human team.

The common theme in all these success stories is the strategic use of data—specifically **legacy data**. Large companies have decades of valuable operational history trapped in old formats like scanned PDFs and unstructured text files. This information was previously unusable at scale. AI is the key that unlocks this trapped value.

It's what allows a company to finally learn from its complete history, shifting from fixing problems to preventing them entirely. This brings us to the core opportunity for the maritime world and for Helix. The same principles can be applied to your operations, today."

### Slide 4: The Opportunity - The Goldmine in Your Data

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   You already possess a strong safety framework (Incident Reports, PTW).
*   This creates a "goldmine" of data—a detailed history of every near-miss and incident.
*   **The Challenge:** This value is locked in unstructured text, hiding crucial patterns and leading to costly reactive cycles.
*   **The Opportunity:** To shift from a *reactive* model (learning after an incident) to a *proactive* one (preventing the next incident).

**What to Say (Script):**
"Helix already has a robust framework for safety, with established systems for incident reporting and Permits to Work. This is the foundation of a strong safety culture.

Within these systems, you are sitting on a goldmine of data. Every incident report, every near-miss observation, and every PTW contains incredibly valuable information. It's a detailed, hard-won history of what has happened on your vessels.

The challenge, however, is that this data is largely unstructured. It lives in PDFs and text descriptions. It's impossible for a human, or even traditional software, to analyze thousands of these reports and connect the dots between seemingly unrelated events.

This leads to a reactive approach. We learn the lesson *after* the incident has already occurred, often at a significant operational and financial cost. The opportunity is to flip that model—to use AI to find the hidden patterns in your existing data and prevent the next incident before it happens."

### Slide 5: The Solution - The AI-Powered Safety Advisor

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   Introducing the **Safety Advisor**: An AI platform designed for proactive prevention.
*   **1. Unlocks & Translates Data:** Automatically reads all your reports (any format) and translates them into structured, analyzable intelligence.
*   **2. Reveals Hidden Risks:** The AI engine analyzes all data to find trends, anomalies, and correlations invisible to the human eye.
*   **3. Powers Proactive PTW:** The game-changer. It creates an intelligent safety net, cross-referencing new work permits with your entire incident history to flag risks *before* work begins.

**What to Say (Script):**
"To seize this opportunity, I've developed the **Safety Advisor**: a platform designed specifically for this task. It does three key things:

First, it's an intelligent data translator. The platform ingests your incident reports—in whatever format they exist—and uses AI to translate that raw text into structured, usable intelligence. It identifies the vessel, location, equipment, conditions, and analyzes the human-written descriptions to understand the true root causes.

Second, it's a risk detection engine. This structured data feeds a dynamic dashboard where the AI actively searches for hidden risks. It connects the dots across your entire fleet's history to find patterns a human simply couldn't see. For example, it can flag that a specific piece of equipment has a higher rate of near-misses during specific weather conditions—an insight that allows for targeted, proactive action.

Third, and this is the true paradigm shift, it creates an intelligent safety net for every single job. When a crew submits a new Permit to Work, the Safety Advisor instantly cross-references the planned task, location, and equipment against your entire historical incident database. If it finds a past incident that shares dangerous similarities with the work about to be performed, it immediately alerts the crew and supervisors, arming them with the critical foresight needed to prevent history from repeating itself."

### Slide 6: Live Demonstration

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   **1. The Central Dashboard:** A fleet-wide, real-time view of safety KPIs and AI-driven forecasts.
*   **2. Seamless Data Onboarding:** Upload a new PDF incident report -> Watch it get processed and integrated in seconds.
*   **3. Proactive PTW in Action:** Create a new work permit -> See the system instantly flag a historical risk and provide the actionable lesson.

**What to Say (Script):**
"Now, I'd like to show you exactly how this works. The data you're about to see is anonymized for this demonstration.

First, we're looking at the central dashboard. It gives you a fleet-wide overview of safety performance. You can see key metrics, but more importantly, the AI has already identified emerging trends. For example, it's forecasting a potential increase in minor deck incidents on certain vessels during the upcoming winter season, based on a pattern it found in the last three years of data.

Next, I'll upload a new incident report as a standard PDF. This requires no special formatting. Watch how quickly the system processes it. Within seconds, the key information has been unlocked, and our dashboard metrics and forecasting models are updated. The data is now an active part of our knowledge base.

Finally, the most critical feature. Let's create a new Permit to Work for 'crane maintenance on the aft deck.' The system instantly flags that a similar job, under similar conditions, was associated with a serious near-miss 18 months ago. It provides the team with a direct link to that report, giving them the critical, hard-won knowledge to perform their work more safely."

### Slide 7: What Makes This Different? The Core Values

**On the slide (Bullet Points):**
*   **Goes Beyond Dashboards:** We don't just *display* data, we *create structured intelligence* from your unstructured text.
*   **Focus on Proactive Prevention:** Standard tools show what happened yesterday. We use that data to help you prevent what could happen tomorrow.
*   **Designed for the User, Built for Trust:**
    *   **Zero Training Required:** A clean, intuitive interface for immediate adoption.
    *   **Explainable AI:** No 'black boxes'. The system shows you *why* it flagged a risk.
    *   **Self-Improving:** The more data it has, the smarter and more accurate it gets.

**What to Say (Script):**
"You might be asking, 'How is this different from a regular business intelligence tool?'

The key difference is that we are not just displaying data; we are creating structured, actionable intelligence from your most valuable and underutilized asset: your unstructured text. We unlock the wisdom that is currently trapped in your documents.

This allows us to be proactive, not reactive. Traditional dashboards show you charts about what happened yesterday. Our system uses that information to tell you what might happen tomorrow, and gives you the chance to intervene.

I've designed this platform with three core principles in mind: It must be so intuitive that it requires zero training. The AI must be explainable. It is not a 'black box.' When it flags a risk, it shows you *exactly* which historical incidents and data points led to its conclusion, ensuring every warning is transparent, trustworthy, and actionable. And finally, the system is designed to learn. The more data it processes, the more accurate it becomes, continuously enhancing the safety intelligence across your fleet."
