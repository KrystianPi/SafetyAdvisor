1. Krystian Introduction
    - Im freelancerem, swiadczy uslugi dla firmy mimira, gdzie stworzylem caly algorytm
    - Opowiedziec o projekcie, o pracy z duza iloscia danych, wyciagania danych z pdf-ow
    - Pracowalem wczesniej w GE gdzie byl problem z bardzo duza iloscia starych danych w nieustruktyrozowanej formie i tam byl mocny push zeby z tego moc budowac inisghts i ja bylem w leading AI team w calym GE Aerospace
    - Zarowno GE jak i Mimira to praca NLP z wyciaganiem danych z bardzo low quality danych, messy data, 

2. Benefits of using AI and current industry trends for large-scale companies and using AI to build insights on large volumes of data
    - insights
    - forecasting
    - predictive maintenance
    - (how can we use AI in safety domain on ships, pattern hidden in the data, not easily visible to a human because its dependant on multiple factors at once. Example)
    - process/workflows optimization

3. Qualities of a good AI-based product, what are the most important qualities I care about when building each product. 
    - high accuracy
    - explainability
    - clean UI/UX
    - easy to use
    - fast evolving/new features

4. How can AI-based application can be applied at Helix?
    - demo time (explain that most of the data is fake for now.)
    - how is this different from a regular dashboard? emphesise extracting data from unstructured text, not only displaying the data but also automatically identifien trends, anomalies, proposing solutions, alerting etc. Self improving system over time. Ease of use, no need for trainign for users. 
    - possible future features
    - how does it work
    - how much does it cost
    - how can we guarantee high quality
    - data security
    - data privacy
  



What is in the demo?
There is a an app with 3 tabs: dashboard, permit to work, incident. The dashboard contains plots, charts, tables etc showing data extracted using LLM from unstructred reports about incidents that happened on drilling ships. The incident tab allows to upload a new report, and permit to work tab allows to upload a new permit to work which immediately process the data and identify historical incidents that share some kind of similariyt with the work that needs to be done (same location+equipent+forecasted wheather etc. )
